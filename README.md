#Google-Book-Search

Google Book Search was created using create-react-app and MongoDB.
 In order to run the app locally on your maching you will need to clone the repo, do a yan install, and then yarn start. You will also need to have mongod running in the command promt. 

The purpose of the app is to allow users to search for books based on a search term and then save interesting books for later view. It accomplishes that by making a call to the Google Books API and displaying results for the user to view. The user can then save an entry into a MongoDB collection and view those saved books in the saved page.
