Google Book Search
========== 

Overview Description
--------------------

Google Book Search allows users to search for books based on a search term and then save interesting books for later view. It accomplishes that by making a call to the Google Books API and displaying results for the user to view. The user can then save an entry into a MongoDB collection and view those saved books in the saved page.
